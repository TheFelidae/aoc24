# Advent of Code - 2024

These is a repo for my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles. I will be using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for all of my solutions.

## Running the solutions

To run the solutions, you will need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can run the solutions by running the following command:

```sh
cargo test
```

This will run all of the tests for the solutions. You can also run the solutions for a specific day by running the following command:

```sh
cargo test day_01
```

### Nix

I maintain a Nix Flake that you can use to help setup or develop the solutions.
You can use the flake by running the following command:

```sh
nix develop
```
